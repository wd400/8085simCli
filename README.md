Ensure you have python installed and is set in your PATH

Some rules for writing a script file

1. You can only enter hex values of the corresponding opcodes of 8085 instruction set.
2. Every hexcode should be on a new line
3. If a hexcode terminates in a semicolon(:), it is considered to be a memory location. The memory pointer will be reset to this location while writing the hexcodes.
4. If a line starts with '/', it is considered a comment
5. Anything other than the above mentioned things will be thrown as error.


The examples directory list few examples of how a script file should be written.
